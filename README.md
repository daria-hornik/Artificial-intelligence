This repository contains projects developed during the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course at the WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- **Lab01**: This folder contains a program that suggests connections between given points on a circuit board. It is based on a genetic algorithm to find the shortest paths and avoid intersections.

- **Lab02**: This folder contains a project for solving the Map Coloring Problem. The map coloring problem involves assigning colors to regions on a map so that no two adjacent regions have the same color.
